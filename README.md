Suggestion: 'FIWARE4WATER platform for water management' 

* Short description. 
  
Describe your teamâ€™s solution in 10 words or less.
  
A curated platform detect of alerts in water management data 

* Long description. 
  
FIWARE4WATER is a project which takes as software base the FIWARE platform. FIWARE platform is a curated framework of open source platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions. A market-ready open source software, combining components that enable the connection to IoT with Context Information Management and Big Data services in the Cloud. It uses Standard APIs for data management (standardized by ETSI standardization body ant therefore available worldwide) and exchange, as well as harmonised data models. the [Smart Data Models initiative](https://smartdatamodels.org) provides the data models. This inititative is an open initiative between [FIWARE Foundation](https://fiware.org), [TMForum](https://tmforum.org), [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in) and [OASC](https://oascities.org) and more than 45 organizations have already contributed. The goal of the platform is to allow automation of processes across the entire value chain. An easy plug&play integration with other solutions and services. And to be part of a marketplace of portable and interoperable solutions. It accounts with more than 150 cities, 21 iHubs.

A [specific architecture]() for water services has been developed, and the presented use case is the first which is created by the community without support of any funding entity. the presented case takes the problem that sampling water sources by a laboratory analysis of water is costly and cannot be done frequently. However, sampling certain parameters of water with cheap sensor are more affordable and possible to be done with high frequency (every hour or less). Thus, the system can be trained to detect/prevent out of range values (alerts) due to correlation between the real alerts based on the laboratory analysis and. Additionally, the data models (the parameter's names and its data types) are standardized in a open and agile standardization initiative, the [Smart Data Models initiative](https://smartdatamodels.org). This  allows its free and open reuse beyond the uses with this platform.

* Solution roadmap. 
  
How mature is your submission and where do you intend to take it from here?

The solution has been tested in a real case scenario in the company [XXX CAP milan use case] with a system . The platform is based on FIWARE solutions a software curated by the non-profit FIWARE Foundation. The European Union endorses the core of this software (the context broker) as a building block for cross-country data services.  
  
Already tested with actual data coming from CAP demo case
