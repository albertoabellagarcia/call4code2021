FIWARE4WATER is a project which takes as software base the FIWARE platform. FIWARE platform is a curated framework of open-source platform components to accelerate the development of Smart Solutions. A market-ready open-source software, combining components that enable the connection to IoT with Context Information Management and Big Data services in the Cloud. It uses Standard APIs for data management (standardized by ETSI standardization body and therefore available worldwide) and exchange, as well as harmonised data models. The [Smart Data Models initiative](https://smartdatamodels.org) provides the data models. This initiative is an open initiative between [FIWARE Foundation](https://fiware.org), [TMForum](https://tmforum.org), [IUDX](https://iudx.org.in) and [OASC](https://oascities.org) and more than 45 organizations have already contributed. The goal of the platform is to allow automation of processes across the entire value chain. An easy plug&play integration with other solutions and services. And to be part of a marketplace of portable and interoperable solutions. It accounts for more than 150 cities, 21 iHubs.

A [specific architecture]() for water services has been developed, and the presented use case is the first which is created by the community without the support of any funding entity. The presented case takes the problem that sampling water sources by a laboratory analysis of water is costly and cannot be done frequently. However, sampling certain parameters of water with cheap sensors is more affordable. Additionally, it is also possible to be done with high frequency (every hour or less). Thus, the system can be trained to detect/prevent out-of-range values (alerts) due to the correlation between the real alerts based on the laboratory analysis and the sampled values. Additionally, the data models (the parameter's names and its data types) are standardized in an open and agile standardization initiative, the [Smart Data Models initiative](https://smartdatamodels.org). This allows its free and open reuse beyond the uses with this platform or use case. The solution is designed to use the machine learning solution of IBM to enable the outliers' detection in the water data.
